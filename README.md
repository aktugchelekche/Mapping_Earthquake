# Mapping_Earthquake
An Interactive Map for Earthquakes 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes  over the world by gathering earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API, create and explore interactive maps 
## Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes. Then add the data to a map.

## Approach
My  approach is to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. I used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.


##### In each map , magnitude of earthquakes was scaled by radius and different color .
